            I never wanted to become a Software Engineer. This can be attributed
            to the fact that my father is a Software Engineer & Architect and my
            mother is a Designer. But I found my passion for engineering during
            college.

            In 2015 I graduated from Siena College in Albany, New York with a
            B.S. in Computer Science. I loved my four years in college. I
            studied abroad at City University in London my Junior year. I took a
            service trip to Haiti my Senior year. And I was manager, and trumpet
            player, for the Pep Band.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Summer between my Junior and Senior years I completed an
            internship at IBM in Poughkeepsie. I worked on WebSphere Application
            Server and learned how to automate the installation of WAS on z/OS
            using Python. I even managed to squeeze in a win for the IBM intern
            video competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating from college I flew down to Austin, Texas to begin
            my career at IBM. During the next two years I would help build the
            UI for the IBM Spectrum Control and Storage Insights offerings. I
            worked primarily with JavaScript, Dojo, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Java
            when I would occasionally contribute to the test automation efforts.
            It was also during this time that I became the Accessibility Lead
            where I was responsible for ensuring W3C Accessibility Compliance
            for both products.

          <p>
            In October of 2017, I was approached by the VP of IBM Systems and
            Transformation. He wanted me to join their design team and help
            prototype in code. I got to work on many incredible projects during
            this time. I build the Linux on Power Developer Portal using
            WordPress. I helped transform the future of Support with the Support
            Transformation team. But my biggest accomplishment was IBM Quantum.
          </p>
          <p>
            I single-handedly build the IBM Q Network website using Vue.js. This
            was a major accomplishment for me, as I had never used Vue for
            proprietary code until this point. The website was a huge success.
          </p>
          <p>
            In February of 2018, I left IBM, sold everything I owned, and flew
            my two cats and myself out to Germany. I had secured a job with
            LogMeIn prior to making the move, and it wasnâ€™t an easy transition,
            but it was so worth the risk. Today I work on GoToMeeting and get to
            develop using React, Redux, Typescript and more.
